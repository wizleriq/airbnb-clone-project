Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mock Up Design.
Identifying the design properties of a mockup is important because it ensures that the final product matches the designer‚Äôs vision. It helps developers understand layout, colors, typography, spacing, and responsiveness. This improves accuracy, consistency, and efficiency during development, reduces misunderstandings, and results in a better user experience.
